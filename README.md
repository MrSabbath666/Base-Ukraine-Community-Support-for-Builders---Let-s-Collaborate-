Hey [Community Name/Event Organizers],

Excited to connect with you all as the official Base Ukraine Community Leader, supported by Base Network! We're incredibly enthusiastic about the upcoming [Buildathon Name] and OnChain Summer and eager to support builders within the Ukrainian community. To maximize participation and empower new builders, we'd love to explore a collaboration. We propose offering exclusive perks to your community, like: Whitelist Spot Raffle: We can raffle off a dedicated number of whitelist spots within our community, driving excitement and participation in both our communities. Content Creation Incentives: We can offer special rewards or recognition for the best projects or content created by participants from your community. We believe this partnership would be mutually beneficial, attracting more talented builders to the Base ecosystem and amplifying the reach of both our communities. We're open to discussing further collaboration opportunities and tailoring our support to best suit your community's needs. Let's connect and explore how we can make this a success together! Best regards, Sabbath0x Base Ukraine Community Leader Supported by Base Network.
